The purpose of this test is to provide a template or guide to follow so that a person performing an empirical study can keep track of and tweak data if needed. 
It starts with explaining that automation of every aspect that can be automated is key to improving an experiment. This allows for increased replicability and 
efficiency. Version control is also very important aspect of the text. Storing data and code under a version control label allows a researcher to find an older
version of a directory with ease helping with organization. Directories help to further organize materials. Creating a high level directory with several 
subdirectories helps to modify analysis without re-running an entire database. A researcher can use these directories to pinpoint an area that needs
tweaking. Keys are also important and help to keep data normalized as far into the experiment as possible. Storing the data in tables with keys that are only 
found with that specific marker keeps data organized and easy to interpret. Abstraction is important because it helps to eliminate redundancy but also to improve 
clarity. Sometimes it is not necessary if it does not help in either of these aspects. It is also not necessary to abstract more than once in a data set.
Paying attention to documentation is also important in a study. If documentation is not going to be maintained by the researcher, it should be avoided so 
to not confuse down the road with comments that contradict the code do not exist. It is also important that the code is self documenting. Lastly, management of
the tasks should be done by a task management system. This effectively eliminates any ambiguity and confusion among a group working on the same project. 
E-mail should especially be avoided because it does not specifically assign tasks to any person.

They believe these elements are so important because they effectively help to eliminate any confusion or issues that may occur during empirical economic research.
Each element solves an issue that is common among research for example: directiories help to find issues and modify analysis with ease, keys help to keep data 
normalized as far into the experiment as possible, and managment systems help to eliminate ambiguity among researches. If a researcher follows these steps, it 
will reduce headaches and major setbacks that occur during research. 

3. 
A group of researchers are using email to communicate and assign tasks rather than using a task management system. One of them emails another requesting that a 
certain think be done but the other takes it as that the person has completed it. If two weeks go by and nothing is done when it should have been would result in
a major setback in time for the researchers. 

4. 
I plan to incorporate these solutions by carefully following the suggestions when performing my research. Using every one of these steps will not only help to 
improve organization but also reduce issues that may occur later in research such as data that is nearly impossible to interpret and redundant.

Git is version control system that tracks changes made to files and allows the user to switch back to a previous version if they wish to do so with ease.
It also allows changes from multiple people to be merged together. GitHub is an online platform that provides several services based on the Git software.
It allows for a group of people to collaborate on a project from anywhere. 

6.
Github is extremely useful for staying organized because it allows integration with R. Without using github it would be difficult to keep work organized and 
readable***

7.
I am completely new to github and do not know how to use the majority of its functions. To reduce the challenge, I will practice using the different commands and 
functions to familiarize myself with to software. With time, I will be to minimize and overcome these challenges. 

8.
Stage: Tells git you want to add changes.
Commit: Tells git you are sure you want to add the changes made.
Pull: Gets any new changes made by collaborators on other computers.
Push: Puts any changes on the github repo.
